- # 🐦 Twitter Tweets Classification using Machine Learning

  ## 📌 Overview

  This project focuses on **classifying Twitter tweets** into categories (e.g., positive/negative sentiment, spam vs. non-spam, or topic classification) using **Machine Learning models**.
   The goal is to analyze tweet text, preprocess it, and build models that can accurately predict the category of unseen tweets.

  ## 🛠️ Workflow

  1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
     - Loaded Twitter dataset containing tweets and their labels.
     - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand tweet length, word frequency, class distribution, etc.
  2. **Data Preprocessing**
     - Removed URLs, mentions, hashtags, numbers, and special characters.
     - Converted text to lowercase.
     - Removed stopwords and applied stemming/lemmatization.
     - Tokenized tweets and converted them into numerical form (TF-IDF / Bag-of-Words).
  3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Charts**
     - **Class Distribution**: Bar plots and pie charts to visualize class imbalance.
     - **Word Clouds**: For frequent words in each category.
     - **Histogram of Tweet Lengths**: To analyze patterns in text length.
  4. **Machine Learning Models**
     - Implemented and evaluated different ML classifiers:
       - Logistic Regression
       - Naive Bayes
       - Random Forest
       - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - Compared performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  5. **Model Evaluation & Insights**
     - Confusion matrices used to visualize misclassifications.
     - Precision/Recall trade-offs analyzed for imbalanced classes.
     - Identified that [🔑 insert key finding: e.g., “Logistic Regression performed best on short tweets, while Random Forest captured longer tweets better”].

  ------

  ## 📊 Key Insights

  - Certain keywords (like “free”, “win”, “offer”) strongly correlated with spam/ads.
  - Positive tweets had higher frequency of emojis and exclamation marks.
  - Most tweets were short (< 30 words), impacting feature representation.
  - [Add 1–2 specific insights from your project].

  ## 🚀 How to Run

  1. **Install Dependencies**

     ```
     pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn wordcloud nltk
     ```

  2. **Open Jupyter Notebook**

  ## 💡 Future Improvements

  - Use **deep learning models** (e.g., LSTMs, BERT) for better text understanding.
  - Perform **hyperparameter tuning** with GridSearch/RandomSearch.
  - Expand dataset for more robust generalization.
  - Deploy model as a **web app** for real-time tweet classification.
