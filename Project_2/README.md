- # Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning

  ## 📋 Project Overview

  This project performs comprehensive customer segmentation analysis using machine learning techniques to identify distinct customer groups based on demographic and behavioral characteristics. The analysis helps businesses understand their customer base and develop targeted marketing strategies.

  ## 📊 Dataset Information

  The dataset contains information about the purchasing behavior of 2,000 individuals from a physical FMCG store, collected through loyalty cards at checkout.

  ### Dataset Features:

  - **ID**: Customer identifier
  - **Sex**: 
    - 0: Male
    - 1: Female
  - **Marital status**:
    - 0: Single
    - 1: Non-single (divorced/separated/married/widowed)
  - **Age**: Customer age in years
  - **Education**:
    - 0: Other/unknown
    - 1: High school
    - 2: University
    - 3: Graduate school
  - **Income**: Annual income
  - **Occupation**:
    - 0: Unemployed/unskilled
    - 1: Skilled employee/official
    - 2: Management/self-employed/highly qualified employee/officer
  - **Settlement size**:
    - 0: Small city
    - 1: Mid-sized city
    - 2: Big city

  ## 📈 Key Insights
  
  The analysis revealed X distinct customer segments:

  1. **Cluster 0**: [Brief description based on your analysis]
  2. **Cluster 1**: [Brief description based on your analysis]
  3. **Cluster 2**: [Brief description based on your analysis]
  4. **Cluster 3**: [Brief description based on your analysis]

  Each cluster exhibits unique characteristics in terms of:
- Age distribution
  - Income levels
- Education background
  - Occupation types
  - Geographical distribution
  
  ## 💡 Business Applications
